          Our Story: The Search for Susegad that Became Amthane Valley
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg text-forest-muted">
          Our journey began with a simple desire: to find a piece of land where our family could experience true Goan Susegad. A place to unwind, to celebrate without a schedule, and to reconnect with nature. We found it here, by the tranquil waters of the Amthane Dam, surrounded by the rustling of palm leaves.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-forest-muted">
          What started as our private haven soon became a place our friends and their families wanted to share. We realized the Susegad we had built was something special. Today, we have opened our gates to you. We&apos;ve added modern comforts, but the essence remains: Amthane Valley is an invitation to experience the Goan way of lifeâ€”a life of leisure, celebration, togetherness, and unhurried joy.
